## 📝 Notes

### Docker Configuration

-   **Project Name:** shopsearch
-   **PHP Version:** 8.4-FPM
-   **Database:** MySQL 8.0
-   **Cache:** Redis
-   **Search Engine:** Meilisearch
-   **Web Server:** Nginx
-   **Access URL:** http://localhost:8000

### Key Learnings

-   Docker service names are used for inter-container communication
-   PHP extensions: core extensions use `docker-php-ext-install`, external use `pecl install`
-   Docker images must be rebuilt after Dockerfile changes
-   `.env` file contains sensitive data and should never be committed to Git
-   Migrations use `Schema::create()` for new tables, `Schema::table()` for modifications
-   Foreign keys ensure data integrity and enable cascade deletes
-   JSON fields in MySQL can be cast to arrays in Laravel for easy manipulation
-   Eloquent relationships: `belongsTo` = many-to-one, `hasMany` = one-to-many
-   Self-referencing relationships allow hierarchical data (categories with parent/children)
-   `HasFactory` trait enables `Model::factory()` method
-   Batch inserts (`DB::table()->insert()`) are 5-10x faster than individual inserts
-   Chunking large inserts prevents memory issues and query size limits
-   `firstOrCreate()` makes seeders idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
-   Factories generate realistic test data using Faker library
-   Seeders populate database with test data in correct order
-   Meilisearch provides fast, typo-tolerant search across large datasets
-   Laravel Scout provides unified API for search engines
-   Filterable attributes must be explicitly configured in Meilisearch
-   Batch imports to search engines are necessary for large datasets

## 🐛 Issues Encountered & Solutions

1. **PHP Version Mismatch**

    - **Issue:** Laravel 12 requires PHP 8.4, but Dockerfile had PHP 8.3
    - **Solution:** Updated Dockerfile to use `php:8.4-fpm` and rebuilt container

2. **Redis Extension Missing**

    - **Issue:** "Class Redis not found" error
    - **Solution:** Added `pecl install redis && docker-php-ext-enable redis` to Dockerfile

3. **HasFactory Trait Missing**

    - **Issue:** "Call to undefined method App\Models\Brand::factory()" error
    - **Solution:** Added `use HasFactory;` trait to all models (Category, Brand, Product)

4. **Duplicate Entry Errors in Seeders**

    - **Issue:** Unique constraint violations when re-running seeders
    - **Solution:** Changed from `create()` to `firstOrCreate()` in CategorySeeder and BrandSeeder to make them idempotent

5. **Meilisearch Filterable Attributes Not Configured**
    - **Issue:** "Attribute category_id is not filterable" error when filtering search results
    - **Solution:** Created `meilisearch:configure` command to explicitly set filterable attributes in Meilisearch
